# Beer-Rating

A C++ 20 console application for rating beers. 

## The problem that needs solving

Every friday I have a beer (just one) ðŸ˜Š to end the work week.
I try to avoid the most commen beers and try to taste a new beer every week.
The problem is that I'm having trouble to remember which beer I have already tasted, but fear not we can solve the problem with code.
